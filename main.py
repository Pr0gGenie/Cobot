'''
this file just scrapes a shit ton of playlists off youtube music just in case you feel like you don't have enough queries
it is completely random and general, use the playlist-scrape scripts for specifics

you can add more specific search in the search_queries list, for example, add "lofi playlists" if you want more random lofi playlists
or "hip hop playlists" and so on so forth

you need to have the library ytmusicapi installed, so use 'pip install ytmusicapi' for that

ONLY use this if you are admin and just want to increase the amount of random, general playlists, 
otherwise its lowkey useless and VERY inefficient and stupid
